# Household Energy Consumption Prediction

## Problem Statement
In the modern world, energy management is a critical issue for both households and energy providers. Predicting energy consumption accurately enables better planning, cost reduction, and optimization of resources. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict household energy consumption based on historical data. Using this model, consumers can gain insights into their usage patterns, while energy providers can forecast demand more effectively.

By the end of this project, learners should provide actionable insights into energy usage trends and deliver a predictive model that can help optimize energy consumption for households or serve as a baseline for further research into energy management systems.

## Project Workflow (Step-by-Step)
1. **Load Dataset** â€“ Read the household energy consumption data
2. **Clean Data** â€“ Remove missing values and invalid records
3. **Outlier Handling** â€“ Use IQR capping to limit extreme values
4. **Correlation Analysis** â€“ Identify relationships between features
7. **Feature Selection & Splitting** â€“ Select inputs and divide into training and testing sets
8. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Linear Regression
   - KNN Regression
   - Decision Tree Regression
   - Random Forest Regression
   - Ridge Regression
9. **Visualization** â€“ Display RÂ², MAE, MSE, RMSE scores in Streamlit dashboard
